Run the main file “SingleObj_Matlab_toolbox.m” to get the optimum point of the design.
The objective function is written as MATLAB function “fminSinObj.m” which will be called when running the main file.
The non-linear inequality and equality constraints are written as MATLAB function “Nonlcon.m” which will be called when running the main file.
dP_hs.m and TR_hs.m are where we defined the heatsink model.
getGeometryProperties.m is for defining geometry and fluid property.
